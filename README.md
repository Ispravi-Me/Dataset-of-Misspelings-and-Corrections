# A Comprehensive Dataset of Spelling Errors and Users’ Corrections in Croatian Language

This dataset contains over 33 million entries with pairs in the form “spelling error → correction” from Ispravi.me, the most popular Croatian online spellchecking service, collected since 2008. 

The dataset, compiled from the contribution of nearly 900,000 users, is a valuable resource for researchers and developers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), improving spellcheck accuracy, and language learning applications. The dataset may be used to accomplish several goals: (1) improving spellchecking accuracy by incorporating common user corrections and reducing false positives and negatives; (2) helping language learners identify common errors and learn correct spelling through targeted feedback; (3) analyzing data trends and patterns to uncover the most common spelling errors and their underlying causes; (4) identifying and evaluating factors that influence typing input; and (5) improving NLP applications such as text recognition and machine translation. Tasks specific to Croatian language include the creation of a letter-level confusion matrix and the refinement of word suggestions based on his-torical usage of the service. This comprehensive dataset provides researchers and practitioners with a wealth of information, opening the path for advancements in spellchecking, language learning, and NLP applications in Croatian language.

We collected a total of 33,382,330 entries of the form "error word → correct word" between December 2008 and March 2023 - 93% of which were of edit distance 1 and 7% of edit dis-tance 2. In this huge dataset, we identified 5,584,226 unique "error word → correct word" pairs. In total, 5,296,266 unique words were misspelled, which we corrected to a total of 1,530,329 words.
